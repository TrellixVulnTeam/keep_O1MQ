Wait for notification that an input or output channel is ready

The new selectors module provides a higher-level interface built on top of the APIs in select.
It is easier to build portable code using selectors,
so use that module unless the low-level APIs provided by select are somehow required.

select() makes it easier to monitor multiple connections at the same time,
and is more efficient than writing a polling loop in Python using socket timeouts,
because the monitoring happens in the operating system network layer, instead of the interpreter.

Using Pythonâ€™s file objects with select() works for Unix, but is not supported under Windows.
